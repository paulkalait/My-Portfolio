# My-Portfolio

## In this repository, You will see my portfolio that contains all the projects I have to showcase.

One of the key components that played a big part in how my portfolio is laid out was flex. By using the flex property i was able to manipulate the containers to wrap and align just how i wanted them to.

This took time and countless efforts of trial and error. The most challenging aspect for me in this project was object fitment of the photos of the projects. 

You will also see that I created hrefs with external links to my contact information.
